# Temperature-Converter-Using-HTML-CSS-and-Java-Script

This is a simple web-based temperature converter that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The user can input a temperature and select either Celsius or Fahrenheit as the starting unit. The application then performs the conversion and displays the result.

## Features

- **Convert Between Celsius and Fahrenheit**: Users can input a temperature and select the unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit). The application will convert it to the other unit and display the result.
- **Extreme Temperature Warnings**: The application displays warnings for extremely high temperatures (above 1000°C or 1832°F).
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Users can press the `Enter` key to perform the conversion without having to click the button.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is simple and works across various screen sizes.

## How to Use

1. Open the webpage in a browser.
2. Enter a temperature in the input field.
3. Select the unit of the temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit) from the dropdown.
4. Click the "Convert" button or press the `Enter` key.
5. The result will be displayed below the input fields.

## Installation and Setup

```

## Code Overview

### HTML (`index.html`)

### CSS (`styles.css`)
- Defines the layout and design, including styles for input fields, buttons, and the overall page layout.
- Includes hover and focus effects for interactivity.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)
